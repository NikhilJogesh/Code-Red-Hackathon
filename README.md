🚀 What's Next?


We're thinking about adding:

Made with ❤️ by two students who just wanted to hang out with friends more easily.



Because life's too short for scheduling stress! 🎉



This version feels more conversational and relatable, like you're talking to fellow students rather than presenting to a corporate board. It keeps all the important info but makes it way more approachable and human!
